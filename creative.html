                    <p>
                        I went inside a tunnel filled with dark <br>
                        Hoping i would see light at the end
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The journey was long i was searching for a spark <br>
                        Searching for a friend who could comprehend
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the midst of tunnel, dark all the way <br>
                        Tired of the hope i couldn't hold my pray
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I realised soon i have to mould <br>
                        I knew , it could make me cold
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I decided to blend , blend with the dark <br>
                        The tunnel was about to end and so was my arc
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The light stinged , it stinged my eyes <br>
                        Its wasn't about me its 'bout journey i emphasize
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now it doesn't matter if i'm at the terminal <br>
                        Coz now i'm the part of tunnel
                    </p>
